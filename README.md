## 📊 Project Overview

The project includes:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing using pipelines
- Training multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation using cross-validation and test accuracy
- Classification reports for detailed performance metrics

## 🚀 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmeddAladdin/NTI_SummerTraining_ML_Final_project.git
   cd NTI_SummerTraining_ML_Final_project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebook or script as needed.

## 📈 Results

Each model's cross-validation and test accuracy are printed, along with classification reports.
